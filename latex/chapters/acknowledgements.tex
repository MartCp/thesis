I would like to thank my supervisors, Ola Martin Lykkja and Yan Zhang, for their support. In addition, I would like to thank Q-Free for giving me the opportunity to work with Ola Martin, as well as supplying me with the necessary equipment to fulfill my work.

A special thank you to Telia which let me perform tests on their network. This gave the thesis an additional dimension and improved the results.

I would also like to thank my family, friends and especially my girlfriend, for supporting me through the last two years completing my master's degree.
